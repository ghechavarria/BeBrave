                    <p>CDC defines bullying as any unwanted aggressive behavior(s) by another youth or group of youths, 
                        who are not siblings or current dating partners, that involves an observed or perceived power imbalance, 
                        and is repeated multiple times or is highly likely to be repeated. 
                        Bullying may inflict harm or distress on the targeted youth including physical, psychological, social, or educational harm.

                        <ul>
                            <li>Look at the kid bullying you and tell him or her to stop in a calm,
                                 clear voice. You can also try to laugh it off. This works best 
                                 if joking is easy for you. 
                                It could catch the kid bullying you off guard.</li>
                            <li>If speaking up seems too hard or not safe, walk away and stay away. Don’t fight back. 
                                Find an adult to stop the bullying on the spot.</li>

                            <li>Talk to an adult you trust. Don’t keep your feelings inside. Telling someone can help you feel less alone. 
                                They can help you make a plan to stop the bullying.</li>
                            <li>Stay away from places where bullying happens.</li>
                            <li>Stay near adults and other kids. Most bullying happens when adults aren’t around.</li>

                        <h2>Stand Up for Others</h2>
                        <p>When you see bullying, there are safe things you can do to make it stop.
                            Talk to a parent, teacher, or another adult you <b>trust</b>. Adults need to know when bad things happen so they can help.
                            <b>Be kind</b> to the kid being bullied. Show them that you care by trying to include them. 
                            Sit with them at lunch or on the bus, talk to them at school, or invite them to do something. 
                            Just hanging out with them will help them know they aren’t alone. 
                            <b>Not saying anything could make it worse</b> for everyone. The kid who is bullying will think it is ok to keep treating others that way.</p>
